# NAT

## DNAT and SNAT 

https://networkinterview.com/snat-vs-dnat/

- SNAT i.e. Source Network Address Translation as the name implies involves the translation of source IP address. Thus it allows the internal host to connect with the internet by translating its private IP address to public IP address. (normal internet browsing)
- DNAT i.e. Destination Network Address Translation is used by an external host to initiate connection with a private network. So, it translates the public IP address of an external host to the private IP of internal Host. (if hosting a webserver @home, SFR box v8 => http://192.168.1.1/network/nat)

## SNAT deep dive 

See [NAT Deep-dive Appendix](NAT-deep-dive-appendix/README.md).

Below we will review some other examples.

## Example of Docker iptables

Used to NAT traffic between host and container (2 linux net namespaces).
See [container under the hood](container-under-the-hood-link-snat-dnat.md).

## Firewall (example of Azure firewall)

AZ900 book, p213 (similar to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal-policy#create-a-default-route without [hub and spoke](https://github.com/scoulomb/myPublicCloud/blob/master/Azure/Networking/basic.md#hub-spoke-network-topology)).

Both **Outbound and Inbound traffic to go through firewall via route table** (AZ900, p218,fig 4.32, it is an UDR: https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClD6CAK&lang=fr%E2%80%A9).
<!-- p217, this will ensure that the firewall will handle all the network traffic to the jumpbox VM and all traffic from server subnet -->

### Firewall rules

See
- https://petri.com/the-three-different-types-of-rules-that-are-in-the-azure-firewall/
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/policy-rule-sets

#### DNAT

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-dnat

For Inbound traffic (to connect via remote desktop to Jumpbox VM), we setup a DNAT rule
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-dnat-policy

p219: NAT rule conllection is DNAT, see SNAT in [SNAT below section](#snat)

From https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/policy-rule-sets
> DNAT rules allow or deny inbound traffic through the firewall public IP address(es). You can use a DNAT rule when you want a public IP address to be translated into a private IP address. The Azure Firewall public IP addresses can be used to listen to inbound traffic from the Internet, filter the traffic and translate this traffic to internal resources in Azur

#### Network rules collection 

From https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/policy-rule-sets
> Network rules allow or deny **inbound, outbound, and east-west traffic** based on the network layer (L3) and transport layer (L4).
You can use a network rule when you want to filter traffic based on IP addresses, any ports, and any protocols.

From  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-flow
> East-west traffic refers to traffic between or within data centers

#### Application rules collection 

> Application rules allow or deny **inbound, outbound, and east-west traffic based** on the application layer (L7). You can use an application rule when you want to filter traffic based on fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) and HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

From https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/policy-rule-sets
To allow application or particular domain

### SNAT

Quoting doc about SNAT private IP address ranges: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/firewall/snat-private-range.md

> Azure Firewall provides automatic SNAT **for all outbound traffic to public IP addresses**. By default, Azure Firewall doesn't SNAT with Network rules when the destination IP address is in a private IP address range per [IANA RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) or shared address space per [IANA RFC 6598](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598). Application rules are always applied using a [transparent proxy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Transparent_proxy) whatever the destination IP address.

> This logic works well when you route traffic directly to the Internet. However, if you've enabled [forced tunneling](forced-tunneling.md), Internet-bound traffic is SNATed to one of the firewall private IP addresses in AzureFirewallSubnet, hiding the source from your on-premises firewall.

> If your organization uses a public IP address range for private networks, Azure Firewall SNATs the traffic to one of the firewall private IP addresses in AzureFirewallSubnet. However, you can configure Azure Firewall to **not** SNAT your public IP address range. For example, to specify an individual IP address you can specify it like this: `192.168.1.10`. To specify a range of IP addresses, you can specify it like this: `192.168.1.0/24`.

> - To configure Azure Firewall to **never** SNAT regardless of the destination IP address, use **0.0.0.0/0** as your private IP address range. With this configuration, Azure Firewall can never route traffic directly to the Internet. 

> - To configure the firewall to **always** SNAT regardless of the destination address, use **255.255.255.255/32** as your private IP address range.


Note Firewall usually do SNAT ([palo alto](https://networkinterview.com/nat-configuration-nat-types-palo-alto/), cisco, [Fortinet](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortigate/6.2.0/cookbook/898655/static-snat)).
But also F5: https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K47945399, which also even offers SNAT pool (many to many NAT type: https://networkinterview.com/nat-configuration-nat-types-palo-alto/ )

**Transparent SNAT**: 
ESB/appli targets external/provider ip -> L4 FW (us) Routing rule to F5 or Firewall and firewall/f5 change source ip (private ip to public ip via SNAT pool) -> FW (ext provider) -> SVC provider (provider sees public IP)

L7 firewall (should also allow NAT): https://serverfault.com/questions/792572/what-does-a-layer-3-4-firewall-do-that-a-layer-7-does-not

[Router and firewall can also provide NAT](NAT-deep-dive-appendix/README.md#type-of-snat)

<!--
**Explicit SNAT**:
ESB/appli targets F5 vip (private ip) -> and F5 has pool member to provider/external IP  -> provider see F5 public IP.
Except if firewall renatting F5 IP - In that case no big added value (for removal) to move to transparent
-->

We can also rely on a transparent proxy for web caching, it relies on WCCP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Cache_Communication_Protocol
Trasmparent proxy can also
- Hide from customer complexity of infra (modify source source IP) => SNAT
    - https://www.stux6.net/unix/linux/proxy-transparent-linux-squid
- Performs IP whitlesting to external
There is overlapp between firewall and proxy: https://waytolearnx.com/2018/09/difference-entre-proxy-et-firewall.html
See https://github.com/scoulomb/misc-notes/tree/master/replicate-k8s-ingress-locally-with-compose#squid-proxy-firewall-open 
<!-- [Link 1]: ~~ SNAT 1A ~~ [replicate-k8s-ingress-locally-with-compose] -->

Even big ip offers WCCP: https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-routing-administration-11-6-0/13.html

Sometimes those proxy makes also certificate shaddowing.

<!-- not sfr box dnat rule in ipv4 become firewall in ipv6 ! -->

<!-- See private_script: [](../private_script/Links-mig-auto-cloud/listing-use-cases/listing-use-cases-appendix-1-mdw-links-si-mq-adds-details.md#outbound-links) [Link 2]: ~~ SNAT 1A ~~ [Certificate] --> 

### SNAT without a firewall

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.

Also this doc confirms port are used to do SNAT.This is port we would see here in proxy protoccol in receiver: https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/tcp/setting-up-tcp?hl=fr
<!-- See private_script: [](../private_script/Links-mig-auto-cloud/listing-use-cases/listing-use-cases-appendix-1-mdw-links-si-mq-adds-details.md#proxy-protocol-activation-for-inbound-links) -->

### In IPV6 how can I add my internal IPs?

Quoting:
> IPv6 was originally designed to work without NAT. That all changed around 2010 with the introduction of NAT66 and NPT66. 

From https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mrw-nat66-00.html
> This document describes a stateless, transport-agnostic IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT66) function that provides the address independence benefit associated with IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT (NAT44) while minimizing, but not completely eliminating, the problems associated with NAT44. 

From https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/xe-16-10/nat-xe-16-10-book/iadnat-asr1k-nptv6.html
> The NPTv6 support on ASR1k/CSR1k/ISR4k feature supports IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6) which enables a router to translate an IPv6 packet header to IPv6 packet header and vice versa. The IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6) provides a mechanism to translate an inside IPv6 source address prefix to outside IPv6 source address prefix in IPv6 packet header and vice-versa. A router that implements an NPTv6 prefix translation function is referred to as an NPTv6 Translator. 

## Azure NSG vs Azure firewall

From https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/firewall-faq. AZ900 p208

> The Azure Firewall service complements network security group functionality. Together, they provide better "defense-in-depth" network security. Network security groups provide distributed network layer traffic filtering to limit traffic to resources **within virtual networks** in each subscription. Azure Firewall is a fully stateful, centralized network firewall as-a-service, which provides network- and application-level protection across different subscriptions and virtual networks.


We can combine with k8s network policy/calico: https://github.com/scoulomb/myk8s/blob/master/Security/3-3-network-policy-AddingDenyAllPolicy.md#network-policy

So VM deployed in subnet. Subnet inside a VNET. Firewall, JumpServer in p125 have same VNET but different subnet (figure, 4-29).
Route table associated to subnet (can be off different VNET).
Then traffic flow through firewall and can apply firewall processing.

NSG rules allow to allow traffic into a subnet (in a VNET) from an address space of another VNET (AZ900, nsg, p210).

Subnet and VM... (even NSG:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group) part of resource group attached to subscription, subscription inside mgmt group (p38).
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview#understand-scope
